---Intro---

This is a project I made for school in 2019 that I recently revisited
trying to improve the code as well as editing the dialouge to get rid
of spelling and grammer mistakes. 

---Disclaimer---

This was made when I had very little programming and python expirence, so please tell me if there's a better way to do any of this.
Also, I have very bad spelling when not using a spellchecker, so I apolgise for any spelling or grammer errors.

---How to Run---

You will need verion 3.8.9 of python or later in order to run. All you need to do is run the python file that should have been included
in the folder this file came in.
